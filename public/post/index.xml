      <description>What is this about? After several attempts I am finally deploying a website. This has been a long journey of trial and error where I have two main sources: This post by Allison Presmanes and this video by John Muschelli.
The website is built with R blogdown and Hugo, a static site generator. It is hosted and deployed in netlifly.com. The template is based on the minimal cactus plus theme.</description>
