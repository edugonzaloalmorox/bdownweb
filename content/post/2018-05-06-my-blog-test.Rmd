The social care in England is living a crisis in the provision of long term care services. This has resulted in a number of closures. This post shows how the intensity of the process since 2010.

### The data

The Care Quality Commission releases monthly information on institutions that decide to close. I am interested in care homes but there is also information available regarding other regulated institutions such as hospitals. Firstly I filter the information referred only to care homes and select variables that will be interesting for the analysis. 

```{r, echo= TRUE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(ggplot2)
library(DT)
library(knitr)

# load data and make variables cleaner
care_homes =  import("data/deregistrations-after-2010.xlsx", sheet = "Deactivated Locations", range = "A7:X35421")   %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(location_id, location_region, location_local_authority, location_hsca_end_date, care_home, location_postal_code, beds =  care_homes_beds_at_point_location_de_activated) %>%
  filter(care_home  == "Y") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("_date")),funs(as.Date))

datatable(head(care_homes,1000), rownames = FALSE,
          options = list(pageLength = 5))


```

## Create relevant variables for visualisation

My aim is to visualise the intensity of the closures.
