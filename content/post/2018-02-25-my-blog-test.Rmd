```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=12, fig.height=8,
                      echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

## What is this about?

After several attempts I am finally deploying a website. This has been a long journey of trial and error where I have two main sources: [This post](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) by Allison Presmanes and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck) by John Muschelli. 

The website is built with R [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator. It is hosted and deployed in [netlifly.com](https://www.netlify.com). The template is based on the minimal [cactus plus](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus) theme. 


The code of this website and other projects is on my [Github](https://github.com/edugonzaloalmorox).
