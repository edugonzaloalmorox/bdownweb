I am a ESRC PhD student in Economics at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/business-school/). I do applied economics with a focus on microeconomic questions specially related to health issues. 

In my PhD I am investigating the market of long term care services in England. I am also interested in elements associated with unhealthy behaviours and tools for open science that involve the use of data and computational methods. 

Before my PhD, I was a NIHR reserch methods fellow in the [Health Economics Group](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/healtheconomicsgroup/) at Newcastle University and prior to that I held several positions as economist in the industry. For further details please click on my [CV](../images/cv-edu_2018.pdf).

In my free time I ride bikes, sometimes [for a while](http://trackleaders.com/transconrace15i.php?name=72___Edu_Gonzalo).
