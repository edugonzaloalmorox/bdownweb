Welcome to my page. I am an applied economist based at [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/business-school/). You can find more details of what I have done what I do in my [CV](../images/cv-edu_2018.pdf)

### _Research and PhD_

My PhD analyses the market of long term care in England. I am using empirical methods for exploring factors that affect the provision and funding of these services. 

The first [working paper](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/81987/1/MPRA_paper_81987.pdf) studies how high prices in the English housing market affects the provision of residential care.
